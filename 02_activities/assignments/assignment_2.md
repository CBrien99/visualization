# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good Example: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kffdata/viz/InsurerParticipationonACAMarketplaces2014-2021/Dashboard1

      The dashboard on insurer participation in ACA marketplaces from 2014 to 2021 demonstrates several strengths that make it an effective and engaging data visualization tool. One of its most notable features is its interactivity. Users can select specific years or states to examine trends over time and across different geographic regions. This interactivity not only increases user engagement but also allows for tailored exploration of the data, making it easier to identify state-level or county-level changes in insurer participation. By including every U.S. county, the visualization provides full geographic coverage, highlighting disparities in insurer availability and revealing patterns such as rural-urban divides or regional clusters with fewer options.

      The color-coding of the map is particularly effective, using intuitive gradients to represent the number of insurers in a given area. This enables quick visual comparisons across regions and years, making trends immediately visible. Supplementary charts and tables further enhance the dashboard, providing numerical breakdowns of insurers entering or exiting the marketplaces. These additional elements support a deeper understanding of the data beyond what the map alone conveys. The clean, minimalist design ensures that the visual elements do not overwhelm the viewer, maintaining clarity while presenting a large amount of information. Overall, the dashboard successfully balances detail and usability, making complex health policy data accessible to a broad audience that may include policymakers, researchers, journalists, and the general public. Its thoughtful layout, intuitive controls, and comprehensive scope all contribute to a user-friendly experience that supports informed analysis of insurer behavior and health coverage trends over time.


      Bad Example: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cedric130813/viz/TheStateofSchoolFeedingWorldwide2022-EduVizzers/Dashboard

      The dashboard on The State of School Feeding Worldwide 2022 â€“ EduVizzers presents global data on school feeding programs, but it is significantly undermined by several design and usability flaws that limit its effectiveness and accessibility. One of the most prominent issues is the poor color contrast between key visual elementsâ€”specifically, the map and the background. The dashboard uses a dark-toned map layered over a similarly dark gray background, resulting in minimal contrast between the two. This design choice makes the geographic data difficult to distinguish at a glance. Countries and regions that should be visually prominent appear to blend into the background, which forces the viewer to strain in order to interpret the data. Although the text is in white and reasonably legible, the mapâ€”the central element of the dashboardâ€”fails to stand out due to this lack of visual differentiation. Also, the country labels on the map have poor colour contrast and could be dificult to see. For a visualization that heavily relies on a world map to communicate regional disparities and program coverage, this represents a major barrier to accessibility and usability.
      The dashboardâ€™s lack of responsive design is also an issue. When opened on a standard browser or laptop screen, much of the content is cut off or awkwardly scaled, requiring horizontal and vertical scrolling to access different parts. This disrupts the visual flow and makes it challenging to view the dashboard as a cohesive whole. On smaller screens, some elements are rendered so small or misaligned that they are practically unusable. A well-designed data dashboard should dynamically adjust to different screen sizes to provide an optimized viewing experience across devices. In this case, the fixed layout suggests the dashboard was designed for a specific large screen size, without sufficient attention to the broader range of platforms users might access it fromâ€”including tablets, laptops, and mobile devices.  


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
     To address the visual and usability issues identified in the dashboard, several targeted improvements could greatly enhance its clarity, accessibility, and overall user experience. First, improving the color contrast between the map and the background is essential. This could be achieved by either lightening the background or applying a lighter, more distinguishable color scheme to the map itself, helping geographic regions stand out more clearly. Additionally, country labels should be recolored with higher contrast tonesâ€”such as white or bright yellowâ€”against the mapâ€™s darker shades to ensure legibility. To resolve layout and responsiveness issues, the dashboard should be redesigned using responsive design principles that allow the content to automatically adjust to different screen sizes and resolutions. This could involve using fluid grid layouts and scalable text and graphics, so that users on laptops, tablets, or mobile devices can interact with the dashboard without having to scroll excessively or zoom in. Interactive elements such as dropdowns and filters should also be repositioned to fit within screen boundaries and grouped logically for intuitive navigation. 
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
